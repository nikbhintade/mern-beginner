# TODO MERN APP

 > This is project is created by following a youtube video so this is not me writing this thing but just copying someone by following the video.

 ## what I want to achieve?

 I just want to learn how authentication with JWT works in MERN stack. As till now I have been working with frontend for very basic application, I have never dealt with authentication. This video tutorial is for clearing my basics of authentication and JWT for both frontnend and backend.

 One more thing, in this video series brad will use react for frontend but I will be changing that and instead I will be using [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/). I wanted to try Qwik for last few weeks but I didn't get a chance so here I am going to use that.
